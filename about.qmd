I'm a developer that has been exploring all types of applications from: native mobile on C++/Android/iOS and crossplatform to backends in different languages doing custom apps, financial apps or core banking services.

I have always liked:

* OS
* Language R&D
* Games
* Artifial intelligence
* Bioinformatics

And in this blog I rant or write on Espa√±ol o English.
